# The Effect of Resistance to Epidemic Measures on Disease Spread and Mortality – What’s the Role of Online Misinformation? (The REMEDY project)
This project aims to connect online and offline behaviour, trying to understand how mis/disinformation on health can influence individual political and health behaviour, which further trickle down to epidemic outcomes and excess mortality (if any). The [REMEDY project](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101107454) is funded by the European Commission and carried out in the French Institute for Demographic Studies.
